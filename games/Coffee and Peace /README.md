# Coffee and Peace

**Team Members:** Andrew

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It is a mix of the game Melatonin and a Coffee Shop

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You take customers orders and you fufill the orders by completing different minigames at each station.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players fufill the orders and they get paid for each order completed, then they can spend that money on upgrades and decorations for the cafe. As the game goes on you can also buy more foods or drinks to sell.
